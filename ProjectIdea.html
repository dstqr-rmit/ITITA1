    <p style='margin-right:0.2cm;margin-left:0.2cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",serif;margin:0.2cm;'><span style='font-family:"Abadi",sans-serif;'>My project idea is to create a workout app. This app will have all the same functionalities of a workout app which allows users to follow workouts and guides to aid in their fitness journey, however, a user&rsquo;s complete workouts, they will receive points which they can save and later redeem for rewards such as coupons, discount codes or gift cards from [sponsoring] stores. The more user&rsquo;s workout, not only will they feel better about themselves, but this workout app offers them an extra reward that no other app will offer. Furthermore, the users will be rewarded for daily streaks of utilising the app, providing more motivation for the users to use the app and workout.</span></p>

This app will target users as people who are looking to either lose weight and/or get fit, those who will take advantage of this opportunity to lose weight and feel good about themselves, whilst getting physically and supportively rewarded. I want to provide users with a friendly easy to use interface and motivative software, solely to provide users with gratitude and feel good about themselves after coming out of quarantine.</span></p>

But that&rsquo;s not the case with this app that I am planning on delivering. This app will be a workout app, providing workouts to suit all people and their needs. Different categories of exercises will be recommended to suit a user&rsquo;s preferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-right:0.2cm;margin-left:0.2cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",serif;margin:0.2cm;'><br></p>

That&apos;s right, a free fully developed workout app that pays you to get fit. Users will be rewarded for completing workouts throughout the app with points, which the user can save up and later exchange for virtual gift cards and other virtual rewards.&nbsp;</span></p>

The app will be designed to not give away more points than it can afford and will vary the reward points through the usage of the app by the user.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family:"Abadi",sans-serif;'>The more user&rsquo;s workout, not only will they feel better about themselves, but this workout app offers them an extra reward that no other app will offer.&nbsp;</span></p>

This app will have all the same functionalities of a workout app which allows users to follow workouts and guides to aid in their fitness journey, however, as user&rsquo;s complete workouts, they will receive points that they can save and later redeem for rewards such as coupons, discount codes or gift cards from [sponsoring] stores.</span></p>

These friends would be able to see the progress and completed workouts of their friends and a timeline of the workouts they have completed (when and where). In addition, friends will be able to set weekly and monthly goals in groups to encourage others to compete and get fit with each other! The monthly winner will be potentially rewarded with a $5 or $10 coupon to one of our major sponsors.</span></p>

    <p style='margin-right:0.2cm;margin-left:0.2cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",serif;margin:0.2cm;'><span style='font-family:"Abadi",sans-serif;'>The tools required for this project idea are only basic coding tools such as: a laptop/computer which has a stable internet connection and will be able to install and run a coding software, a user feedback program/software to receive user feedback on the app, a coding software which allows for the installation of extensions and has the ability to run programs as a GUI from a given programming language (e.g. Tkinter in Python). Some technologies which may be required could be a time management software &amp; servers and routers [in the far future] which would store the app&rsquo;s user data on a database.</span></p>

    <p style='margin-right:0.2cm;margin-left:0.2cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",serif;margin:0.2cm;'><span style='font-family:"Abadi",sans-serif;'>Skills required to develop this project idea are: knowledge of a programming language that can utilise a GUI, how to communicate with users and third-party customer service representatives in a friendly manner &ndash; to establish a good relationship between the app and its sponsors, and to have standard mathematics knowledge to aid in correcting calculation errors found within the code/app. To obtain the required coding knowledge, I could potentially enrol into online programming courses or visit companies through work experience that specialise in the field. In addition, I will also be required to conduct extensive online research into the most effective and efficient GUI programs in different programming languages. Additionally, I am required to know: 1. How servers and routers work with each other to communicate data, 2. How to create, edit and store data in databases, and 3. Have problem-solving experience with servers, routers and databases in case some small issues do arise and would be more cost-effective in the short term and long term for the platform. </span></p>

    <p style='margin-right:0.2cm;margin-left:0.2cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",serif;margin:0.2cm;'><span style='font-family:"Abadi",sans-serif;'>If the project is successful, the outcome will be a fully functional motivational workout app that has users using the app daily, continuously motivated to workout. This will solve the global issue of unmotivated fitness! The development of this app will create a new revolution amongst the fitness world, increasing the number of people interested in fitness, allowing not only this workout app to take off but the entire fitness industry. People will be using this app to workout everywhere, from their homes and gyms to their backyards and local park. The sponsoring companies will also be receiving more than double the usual traffic and income allowing them to continuously grow too!</span></p>
